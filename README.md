# Mauvais-Coin
Interface Web based on french application Bon Coin (purchase and sale of anything )

This is a study project on faculty of Computer Science, so I used MySQL Syntax compatible with the servers on PHP 4 or 5.
According to official documentation (http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-query.php) you can`t deploy it on server with PHP 7 and above.
Instead, the MySQLi extension should be used.

Settings of database access: identifiants.php (I use USBWebServer)
SQL creation of tables: SQL/creation_tables.sql
Main page: accueil.php

This application allows to create, search by filters, edit and delete your announcements.
